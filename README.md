# ab-see
Straightforward shortcodes for A/B testing with WordPress.

## Overview
Want to start a split-test right away? Choose a unique test id, provide a piece of code for the first group and a piece of code for the second, and define an id to indicate a conversion.

For example, let's define a split test called *clothes*. In the first group, we'll say "Your clothes are red." In the second group, we'll say "Your clothes are black." When we convert, we'll use the id *clothes_complete*.

Then, we'll do this:

**On your test page:**

&lt;a href="convert.php"&gt;**[ab-see id=clothes]**&lt;/a&gt;

**Somewhere in convert.php:**

**[ab-convert id=clothes_complete]**

And that's it.
